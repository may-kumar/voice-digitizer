<h1 align="center">Voice Digitizer</h1>

Using an 8086 processor, a voice signal is to be recorded and reproduced.
Input is taken through a microphone, sampled and digitized by a 8-bit ADC at a frequency 1000 sample per second.
The digitized signal is to be stored in RAM. The signal for a period of
6 seconds has to be digitized.<br/>
The voice stored has to be reproduced with delay when user closes a
switch labeled **sound replay**.
The delay to be entered by the user are numbers from 1-9, with the
help of a key-pad. <br/>
The keypad has digits 0-9, backspace and enter.
A seven segment display has to be provided with the keypad to
display the delay value entered by the user.
The delay is between samples â€“ If value entered in is 5 then delay
between two adjacent samples when reproduced is 5ms.
